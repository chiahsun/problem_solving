# solve1.cc

Swift too slow deals with I/O and string to int so we solve using c++.

AND xor OR = xor

We use greatest significant bit to bisect sets until less or equal to 2 elements(except for elements all equal).

Any element in this set when xor with element in another set would have significant bit on, so minimum value can only exists in the sasame set.

Deal with boundary cases carefully.
