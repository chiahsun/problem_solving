[Claim]
For a size M x N chocolate, there exists an optimal method to split it into M x N unit size chcolates and the dividing cost = M * N - 1.

[Proof]
We prove it by the following two proofs.
 (1) Lower bound: M * N - 1 = SZ - 1
 (2) Existence of the method for deriving the lower bound

[Proof for (1)]
 For any chocolate of size C = A + B, if we divide it into two parts of size A and B, then the 
    cost = cost(A) + cost(B) + 1 = C - 1
 (i) Base case: 1 x 1 chocolate
     the cost = 0 = 1 * 1 - 1
 (ii) For any two chocolate that has optimal cost A = (a x b) and B = (a x c) no matter a, b, c, as long as (a equals one side) and (b+c equals another side)
     the optimal cost for the chocolate that is the combination of the two, C = a x (b + c)
     the cost = a * b - 1 + a * c - 1 + 1
              = a * (b + c) - 1

[Proof for (2)]
 Consider a dividing method on M x N chocholate.
 Split it into N  M x 1 chocholate (cost = N-1)
 Split each Mx1 chocholate into 1x1 chocolate (cost = N*(M-1))
 The cost = N-1+N*(M-1) = N*M-1

By (1)(2), we conclude the proof.
