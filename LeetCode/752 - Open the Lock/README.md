Change string concat method which is faster.(+ is faster than "".join) [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1228299/change-one-character-in-a-string/1228327#1228327) [Reference solution](http://bookshadow.com/weblog/2017/12/24/leetcode-open-the-lock/)
(Maybe it reuse original string if possible and there is only three elements)
("".join is O(n) I think and "+" should be O(n^2)) (Or changed?)
